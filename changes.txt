CHANGED:
Player:
- position is an int (not a Square)
- Buying properties:
    - buyOrDeny() returns a boolean
    - pay() can be used to pay a player if one is provided, otherwise pays the bank
    - If buyOrDeny() is true, pay() will be called with no player provided (i.e. pay
        the bank), and a GSC will be returned making the payment

Auction sequence:
- When asked to bid, player returns an int with their bid
- If the player wins, the engine calls pay() with that bid, and the player then returns a GSC making the payment
- GS applies the changes


NEED TO ADD:
Property:
- Instance variable for number of properties in the property group

GameState:
- Method to check if a given GSC builds evenly
    - Insert after checking are_enough_houses in seq-diag-decision-making
- Added hotels_remaining and houses_remaining properties
- Added are_enough_hotels method

Engine:
- Removed initialize() method
- Added run() method

Card:
- Also uses GameStateChange.combine() in pay_each_player_50() and receive_50_from_each_player()
