	"description": "The DecisionMaker represents the 'brain' of the Player. Whenever the Player must take action on some event, it outsources its decision-making process to its DecisionMaker, which then returns the action it 'thinks' is in the Player's best interests. It is designed as an interface, which defines a method for each of the possible decisions a Player must make in the game. We designed the decision-making process this way to enable different Players to have different 'strategies', which are defined by their respective DecisionMakers. An instance of DecisionMaker must implement all of the methods defined in this API.",
